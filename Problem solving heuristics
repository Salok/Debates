(Probablemente sea útil poner ejemplos de cada una de ellas, así que buscaré alguno. Y si se os ocurre, ponedlo.)
Maths and Physics: 
Define the problem. How does it look like to have solved it? What about the general case?
Solve it symbolically and only if absolutely necessary substitute numerically. 
Try solving it from first principles. 
If first principles fail, find an easier version of the problem which is solvable. (Try approximating or simplifying some of the conditions.)
If a problem is too easy solve the general case. 
Try cross-modeling (see if a model for a different object can be used for the one you are trying to solve.)

To avoid pitfalls: 
State your assumptions every time you are making one. 
Ask yourself in every step if you are making an implicit assumption. 
State your formulas before using them. 
Explain the procedure as you go.
